Problem Statement

Stock market prediction is defined as “the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or
other financial instrument traded on an exchange”. Predicting future values of stock prices can yield great
profits for the company. However, the task is not particularly an easy one as it can involve numerous factors
(both physical and psychological), making share prices particularly volatile. Investment banks are
institutions that act in an advisory role to help companies, individuals or governments make financial
transactions.
Major shareholders of the media conglomerate, Waystar Royco (WAYA US) have hired the investment
bank you work at, as consultants to analyse their performance in the stock market and make future
predictions. Your team, as business analysts in the investment bank, has to predict the closing stock price of
the company from 30th July, 2021 to 10th September, 2021 as accurately as possible, given data from 14th
August, 2015 to 29th July, 2021. The data you have been provided with, consists of the opening, high, low
and closing price of Waystar Royco’s stock as well as the volume of stocks traded in a day, for 1500
days. Your team has been instructed to use ONLY this information and disregard any other factors while
making predictions. In addition to this, the bank also wants to know what models are best suited for stock
price predictions given similar data and wants your team to perform a comparison between regression and
time series models so that they know what to adopt for future scenarios.
